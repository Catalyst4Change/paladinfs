      <p>
        Wondering who will carry out your wishes after you are gone? Are you at
        the beginning of your estate planning journey and need a guide?
        Fiduciaries can help you or a loved one with daily money management,
        monthly budgeting, and long range financial planning. A private
        professional fiduciary can administer special needs trusts as well.
        Californiaâ€™s regulatory licensing board helps identify qualified
        individuals. A fiduciary provides caring and experienced assistance to
        an elder in California, and can avoid or resolve intra-family conflict
        associated with various legal roles. A Fiduciary can act as a trustee,
        administrator of an estate, or as Conservator. A Fiduciary can also
        serve as Power of Attorney for Finance and/or Health Care.
