        title="What Is a Daily Money Manager?"
        content={`A daily money manager is a person who takes over someone’s day-to-day financial tasks. A variety of people employ daily money managers, ranging from elderly clients to those simply too busy to maintain total control and accuracy of their financial needs. Daily money managers offer services to ensure nothing falls through the cracks, including necessities like paying monthly bills, assisting with tax records, balancing checkbooks, decoding medical bills, and negotiating with creditors. Other services may include notarization, payroll management, health care advocacy, or acting in another fiduciary capacity. \n
        \#Understanding Daily Money Manager (DMM)\n
        Daily money managers deliver essential financial services to seniors and older adults, people with disabilities, busy professionals, high net worth individuals, small businesses, and others. The demand for daily money managers has grown steadily in recent years, due largely to a growing elderly population. As their parents grow old, children often take over their financial tasks, but many find themselves unable to do so because of their work and family commitments. The growth of the industry can also be attributed to the increase in dual-income families: With both parents working, there is often not enough time to run around ensuring documents are properly signed or bill payments are processed on time. Wealthy people may hire daily money managers to avoid taking care of menial money tasks, or because they feel their time is better spent doing other things that could earn them more money. \n
        \#How Daily Money Managers Work\n
        Let’s assume a man is elderly and lives alone. His wife, who used to handle the bills, insurance, shopping, budgeting, record-keeping, and investing, died a year ago. His two children feel he is too overwhelmed and distracted to care for these things effectively. They both work, as do their spouses, and they have children of their own to take care of. The man, or his children, hires a daily money manager to help out. \n
        The daily money manager pays all of the person’s bills, handles things if he is billed incorrectly, balances his checkbook, prepares and makes bank deposits for him, gets his tax information ready, and ensures that his medical bills are processed and paid correctly. The daily money manager visits him at home twice a month to discuss recent activity and future plans.`}

        title="2024 Updates"
        content={`As we welcome the new year, it's crucial to assess legislative changes affecting the documentation required for income tax returns. Though no significant federal tax policy shifts occurred in 2023, prior-year changes will influence 2023 and 2024 returns. Notable changes include adjustments to energy-efficient residential improvements and electric vehicle credits, retirement planning reforms, revisions in 1099-K reporting, and the implementation of beneficial ownership reporting requirements.\n\n
        \#Energy Efficiency Credits:\n\n
      In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act altered home improvement tax credits, extending the effective claiming period for the Residential Clean Energy Credit to 2034. This non-refundable credit, applicable to any US residential property, now lacks a lifetime limit. Documentation for energy-efficient home improvements is vital for tax preparation.
      \n\n\#Clean Energy Vehicle Credits:
      \n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act expanded the types of vehicles eligible for energy credits, removing the production limit and introducing credits for previously owned Clean Energy Vehicles starting in 2023. Documentation for vehicle details and eligibility can be found at [link].\n\n
      \#Retirement Planning Changes:\n\n
      SECURE Act 2.0, enacted in December 2022, adjusted retirement account regulations. Notably, it increased the age for starting Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) to 75. Beneficiaries of inherited IRAs now face distribution changes, and RMD penalties were reduced under this legislation.\n\n
      \#Contributions and Establishment of Retirement Accounts:\n\n
      SECURE Act 2.0 introduced contributions and establishment changes, impacting employer-sponsored plans and encouraging employers to support student loan payments, Roth contributions, and emergency savings plans. Additionally, 529 accounts can now serve dual purposes for college and retirement savings.\n\n
      \#1099-K Reporting:\n\n
      Reporting thresholds for 1099-Ks were lowered to $600 by the American Rescue Plan of 2021, originally scheduled for 2022 but delayed to 2023. As of Dec 31, 2023, the IRS announced a threshold of $20,000 and 200 transactions for 2023, transitioning to $5,000 with no transaction minimum in 2024. Taxpayers should verify and share 1099-K information with their tax preparers.\n\n
      \#Corporate Transparency Act:\n\n
      Effective January 1, 2024, the Corporate Transparency Act mandates business entities, including most small businesses and rental property owners, to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. The goal is to combat terrorism and money laundering.\n\n
      Note that RMDs are not required for Roth IRA accounts during the original owner’s lifetime.  Until 2024, RMDs were required to be taken from Roth 401k accounts, even though the distributions are not taxable.  The SECURE Act 2.0 modified the RMD requirements for Roth 401k accounts to be consistent with Roth IRA accounts.\n\n
      \#Contributing Funds For Retirement:\n\n
      The SECURE Act 2.0 changed not only the rules regarding withdrawals and penalties, but also contributions and the establishment of retirement accounts.\n\n
      Many of the new contribution provisions apply only to employer sponsored plans, but may apply to Simplified Employee Plans (SEPs) for self-employed individuals or other small business owners.  The legislation includes improved coverage for part-time employees and spouses of active military as well as incentives and credits for small businesses to establish retirement plans.\n\n
      Employers may now make “matching” contributions to a 401k plan for employees who are making student loan payments.  There are also new provisions enabling employers to make Roth contributions to employee retirement plans (not only traditional pre-tax contributions), including to SEP and SIMPLE accounts.  Employers can also create emergency savings plans tied to defined retirement contribution plans.  This last provision allows employers to encourage their non-highly compensated employees to save for retirement and set aside funds for emergencies.\n\n
      Congress also is allowing 529 accounts to be dual purpose – saving for college and for retirement.  Beginning in 2024, taxpayers can rollover 529 funds into a Roth IRA, provided certain conditions are met. This new dual purpose encourages families to continue contributing to 529 accounts even if they are uncertain whether the beneficiary will be attending college or will have all of their educational expenses covered by scholarships and grants.\n\n
      \#1099-Ks:\n\n
      Statistics show that taxpayers are more likely to report their income when they receive tax information reporting documents such as 1099s, 1098s or W2s.  1099-Ks are required to be issued by third party payment processors, such as credit card processing companies as well as payment apps (Paypal, Venmo, CashApp, etc) and online marketplaces (Etsy, Poshmark, etc).  Previously, a 1099-K was only required to be issued to someone who had income of $20,000 and 200 transactions if goods were sold or services were provided.\n\n
      The American Rescue Plan of 2021 lowered the reporting threshold for 1099-Ks from $20,000 to just $600, with no minimum number of transactions.  The new, lower, reporting requirements were originally scheduled to be implemented for 2022, but the industry pushed back due to the extra work required to meet the lower threshold.  The IRS initially gave the industry another year, to 2023 to implement.  However, as of Dec 31, 2023, the IRS announced that for 2023, the reporting requirements will remain at $20,000 and 200 transactions, and that 2024 will be a transition year with a threshold of $5000 with no transaction minimum.\n\n
      The receipt of a 1099-K, however, does not change the taxability of the income.  The sale of an extra pair of concert tickets may not be taxable, but may result in the issuance of a 1099-K.\n\n
      Since the IRS computer systems are becoming more efficient at flagging taxpayers with income documents that are not reported on the tax return, it is important that taxpayers go online to identify whether a 1099-K (or other information reporting document) was issued, and provide that information to their tax preparer.\n\n
      \#Corporate Transparency Act:\n\n
      While not tax legislation, the Corporate Transparency Act will likely impact a large number of taxpayers – including self-employed individuals and rental property owners.\n\n
      On January 1, 2021, the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) was signed as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020.  This legislation is a follow-up to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1974 which required banks and other financial institutions to identify and verify beneficial owners.\n\n
      The purpose of the CTA is to help law enforcement detect, prevent, and punish terrorism, money laundering and other misconduct by requiring business entities to report their beneficial owners directly to the federal government.  It is also meant to bring the U.S. into compliance with international anti-money laundering standards.\n\n
      Starting January 1, 2024, companies required to provide beneficial ownership information may register directly with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is a division of the U.S Treasury.  They must submit a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report which includes the full legal name, current residential address, date of birth, and a unique government identification number for each beneficial owner of the company.\n\n
      Most small businesses formed at the state level, including LLCs and S-Corporations, must file a BOI report.  Exempt from filing are what are called large operating entities. There are also exemptions for a number of types of businesses such as banks and non-profits.  Therefore, most individuals or partnerships that created an LLC for their self-employment income or rental property will need to file.  The FinCEN website has tools to assist in determining who needs to file and how to do so.\n\n
      \#Looking Forward: Possible Changes Retroactively Affecting 2023\n\n
      While no significant tax legislation was passed in 2023, the federal budget for the 2023-2024 fiscal year still has not been approved.  Congress often includes tax policy changes in the various appropriations bills, and sometimes includes retroactive provisions.\n\n
      Some of the proposals which may be retroactive include expensing research and development costs, higher bonus depreciation, increasing the state and local tax cap for itemized deductions, and an expanded child tax credit.\n\n
      None of these will likely alter what documents taxpayers need to provide to their preparer, but may significantly impact the tax return.  So, don’t be surprised if this tax season tax professionals are encouraging their clients to delay filing in order to take advantage of the latest changes.
